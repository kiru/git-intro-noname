Mac mini and Apple Silicon M1 review: Not so crazy after all Ars Technica · by
Samuel Axon · November 19, 2020 Apple is crazy, right? The Mac just had its
best year of sales ever, and Cupertino is hitting the platform with a shock
like it hasn’t had in nearly 15 years—back in a time when the Mac was not
having such a good year. Apple is beginning the process of replacing
industry-standard Intel chips with its own, custom-designed silicon.

In a way, we're not just reviewing the new Mac mini—a Mac mini is always a Mac
mini, right? We're reviewing an ARM-based Mac for the first time. And this is
not exactly the same story as all the other ARM machines we've looked at
before, like Windows 10 on ARM—a respectable option with some serious
tradeoffs.
